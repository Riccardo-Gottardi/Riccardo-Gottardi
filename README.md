# A glimpse of human touch
## Favourite films
| Film | Motivation
| ---- | ----------
| **Interstellar** | One of the few films that has aroused a wide range of emotions in me
| **The Gentleman** | I have loved the narration of the film
| **Tenet** | I started to understand the film by half of it. From that point on I found the idea around which the film is orbiting facinating
